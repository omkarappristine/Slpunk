Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit

Recently I started with learning about Splunk and I got to know that there is so much we can do using Splunk. As being a Data Analyst, Splunk offers me a variety of application options to study and use them in a real world scenario. So I started with Machine Learning Toolkit with Splunk. 

But before you start with the Machine Learning toolkit you need to know about Machine Learning. Machine Learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task.  

KEY TERMINOLOGY AND KEY CONCEPTS
AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

- [ ] AI - Anything that simulates human intelligence by any means.
- [ ] ML - AI, but with more advanced algorithms and statistics.
- [ ] DL - ML, but with multiple layers (hence - “deep”).
- [ ] Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
- [ ] Data Munging
- [ ] No “one size fits all” Algorithms
- Prediction
- Forecasting
- Clustering
- Outlier detection

How does Machine Learning Toolkit help?
- [ ] MLTK lower to bar to entry into ML - that means no need to learn Python or R.
- [ ] Combined with Splunk, makes data munging much easier.
- [ ] Splunk has heaps of data which you can work on.
- [ ] Allows you to work with industry standard libraries and algorithms.
- [ ] Makes is easy to quickly analyse the results.
